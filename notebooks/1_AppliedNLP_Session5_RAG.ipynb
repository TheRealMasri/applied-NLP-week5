    "# Session 5 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a **minimal RAG pipeline** using Lewis Carroll's two Alice books as our corpus as usual:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*\n",
    "- *Through the Looking-Glass*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT**: It is **highly recommended** to use a virtual environment for this session!  \n",
    "> The packages and downloaded models (embeddings, transformers) can easily reach over **1 GB** in size.  \n",
    "> Using a venv keeps your system clean and makes it easy to manage these large dependencies and delete them when not needed anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances LLM responses by:\n",
    "1. **Retrieving** relevant information from a knowledge base (your documents)\n",
    "2. **Augmenting** the LLM prompt with this retrieved context\n",
    "3. **Generating** an answer based on both the question and the retrieved information\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows LLMs to answer questions about documents they weren't trained on, and reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load** the two books as plain text  \n",
    "2. **Split** them into **overlapping chunks** (text segmentation)  \n",
    "3. **Create embeddings** for each chunk (convert text to vectors)  \n",
    "4. **Store** them in a **vector database (FAISS)** for efficient similarity search  \n",
    "5. **Build** a **retrieval + generation chain** to answer questions about the books  \n",
    "6. **Query** the system with natural language questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on understanding the *pipeline*, not on perfect model choices. You can swap components (embeddings, LLMs, vector stores) as needed."

    "\n",
    "### Parameters Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`chunk_size`**: Maximum number of characters per chunk (default: 800)\n",
    "  - This is a **hard limit** - chunks won't exceed this size\n",
    "  - Too small → loses context, more chunks to search\n",
    "  - Too large → less precise retrieval, may exceed embedding model limits\n",
    "  - **Typical range**: 500-1500 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`chunk_overlap`**: How much neighboring chunks overlap (default: 150)\n",
    "  - Ensures sentences near boundaries aren't split awkwardly\n",
    "  - Helps maintain context across chunk boundaries\n",
    "  - **Typical range**: 10-20% of chunk_size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`separators`**: Priority order for splitting points\n",
    "  - These determine **where** to split when approaching the chunk_size limit\n",
    "  - The splitter tries each separator in order to find a natural break point:\n",
    "    1. `\\n\\n` → paragraph breaks (preferred - most context preserved)\n",
    "    2. `\\n` → line breaks\n",
    "    3. `. ` → sentence endings\n",
    "    4. ` ` → word boundaries (last resort)\n",
    "  - **Key point**: The splitter builds chunks up to ~800 chars, then looks for the best separator to split on\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If text reaches 780 characters, the splitter looks for the first `\\n\\n` (paragraph break). If found, it splits there (even if only 750 chars). If not found, it tries `\\n`, then `. `, then ` `. This keeps chunks **under 800 chars** while breaking at **natural boundaries**.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you ask a question:\n",
    "1. Question → embedding vector\n",
    "2. Vector database → finds 4 most similar chunks\n",

    "- **Accuracy**: Is the information correct per the source?\n",

    "- **Completeness**: Does it cover all relevant aspects?\n",
    "- **No hallucination**: Does it avoid making up information?\n",

    "- Need synthesis across multiple passages\n",
    "- Ask about comparisons between the books\n",

      "\n",
      "In Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass,\" the differences between Wonderland and the world\n",
      "behind the looking-glass are starkly illustrated through Alice's experiences.  On one hand,\n",
      "Wonderland is a fantastical realm that exists parallel to the real world. As Alice notes, \"she knew\n",
      "she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\" (Chapter 1). This suggests\n",
      "that Wonderland is a separate entity from the everyday world, with its own unique laws and logic.\n",
      "In contrast, the world behind the looking-glass appears to be a reflection of the real world. Alice\n",
      "observes that \"the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace\"\n",
      "(Chapter 1), indicating that this world is familiar and mundane. The fact that the fire is \"blazing\n",
      "away as brightly as the one she had left behind\" (Chapter 1) further emphasizes the similarity\n",
      "between these two worlds.  Furthermore, Alice's interactions with the Red Queen and other creatures\n",
      "in Wonderland are often at odds with the behavior of their counterparts in the real world. For\n",
      "example, when Alice tries to get the kitten to imitate the Red Queen, it fails miserably, leading\n",
      "Alice to threaten to send it through the looking-glass (Chapter 1). This suggests that the rules of\n",
      "Wonderland do not necessarily apply to the real world.  However, as Alice navigates both worlds, she\n",
      "begins to realize that they are not entirely separate. She notes that \"the lowing of the cattle in\n",
      "the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs\" (Chapter 1), implying that there\n",
      "is a connection between the two worlds. This blurring of boundaries highlights the idea that\n",

      "Wonderland and the world behind the looking-glass serve to underscore the fantastical nature of\n",

      "In both \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\", Alice is referred to as\n",

      "highlights her boredom and desire for something exciting to happen.  In \"Tweedledum And Tweedledee\"\n",
      "(CHAPTER IV), Alice is referred to as \"Little Alice\" when she is talking to herself, recalling\n",
      "memories of her little sister's dream. This emphasizes her youthful and innocent nature.  When Alice\n",
      "meets the two fat little men, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in this chapter, they address her as\n",
      "\"Alice\". This marks a turning point in their interaction, as they begin to engage with her directly.\n",
